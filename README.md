# V Profile 
The architecture of the automated setup involves orchestrating the integration of various 
services and components through Vagrant scripts. Git Bash is employed as the primary 
command-line tool, and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) serves as the integrated 
development environment (IDE) for code development and collaboration.
The project's multi-tier nature provides a comprehensive environment for developers to 
work on different aspects of the application, from server-side scripting with 
PHP/Python/Perl, managing databases with MySQL, to handling web server 
configurations using Apache and NGINX. Additional components such as Tomcat, 
RabbitMQ, and Memcached are seamlessly integrated to support diverse functionalities 
and improve the overall performance of the application.
This comprehensive setup not only streamlines the local development process but also 
allows for thorough research and experimentation. Developers can use this environment 
to conduct R&D activities, test new features, and explore innovative solutions before
deploying changes to the production environment. The inclusion of version control with 
Git ensures collaboration and version tracking, while Vagrant and VirtualBox provide 
a flexible and scalable infrastructure for local development.
In summary, this project establishes an automated, code-driven, and modular local 
environment for multi-tier web application development, empowering developers to 
conduct efficient research and development using a diverse set of services and tools. 
The combination of LAMP stack, NGINX, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcached, and 
MySQL within a WordPress-based application creates a robust platform for innovation 
and collaborative development.
